Aim: The code aims to create a simple motion detection program using a webcam feed in Python.
❖
Implementation:
➢
It uses the OpenCV library (cv2) to capture video from the webcam and perform image processing.
➢
The program detects motion by comparing consecutive frames from the webcam feed.
➢
When motion is detected, it triggers a beep sound using the simpleaudio library.
➢
Detected motion events are recorded with timestamps in a Pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file.
❖
Applications:
➢
Home security: Detect intrusions or movement in specific areas.
➢
Surveillance: Monitor activities in a given space.
➢
Automation: Trigger actions based on detected motion, such as turning on lights or sending notifications.
➢
Research: Analyze movement patterns or behaviors in various environments.
